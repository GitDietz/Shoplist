setups:

python3 manage.py startapp work_posts

Clearing the db to implement Slug or just fix major issues:
add slugfield to Post model
delete all content of the image/media_Cdn folder
delete all migrations (NOT --init--.py!)


Fixing migrations without deleting the db:
-----------------------------------------
python manage.py migrate --fake appName zero
python manage.py showmigrations
then delete all the migrations (not the __init__ file)
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
After this I checked the db structure - found that a new column did not exist, but its in the model
commented it out, then make migrations / migrate
then added it back in and repeated
