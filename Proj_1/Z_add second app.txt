============================
python manage.py startapp comments
create a model for it with a foreign key to the Posts model
register the site in admin
thenmake migrations / migrate
add a comment in admin
add the property to the template  {{ instance.comment_set.all }}
so to display the comment

generic foreign keys
====================
use of {{ instance.comment_set.all }} will no longer work since there is a new relationship

this uses a relation between the object type and the object ID like a composite key
